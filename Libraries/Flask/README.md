# Flask Quickstart

## Basic app
Quick start a Flask app. To write in `main.py`:

```Python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Hello World'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run("127.0.0.1", port=5000, debug=True)
```

## Variable rules
Flask can define types and will convert any given input to these types

```Python
from markupsafe import escape

@app.route('/user/<username>')
def show_user_profile(username):
    # show the user profile for that user
    return 'User %s' % escape(username)

@app.route('/post/<int:post_id>')
def show_post(post_id):
    # show the post with the given id, the id is an integer
    return 'Post %d' % post_id

@app.route('/path/<path:subpath>')
def show_subpath(subpath):
    # show the subpath after /path/
    return 'Subpath %s' % escape(subpath)
```

#### Converter types:
| Types |   |
|---|---|
| `string` | (default) accepts any text without a slash |
| `int` | accepts positive integers |
| `float` | accepts positive floating point values |
| `path` | like `string` but also accepts slashes |
| `uuid` | accepts [UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) strings |

#### What is markupsafe ?
*[MarkupSafe](https://markupsafe.palletsprojects.com/) escapes characters so text is safe to use in HTML and XML. Characters that have special meanings are replaced so that they display as the actual characters. This mitigates injection attacks, meaning untrusted user input can safely be displayed on a page.*

## HTTP methods

`GET` and `POST` are the two commonly used HTTP methods. Here is an example about how to use them:

```Python
from flask import request

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        return do_the_login()
    else:
        return show_the_login_form()
```

#### Methods list

| Methods | Definitions |
|---|---|
| **GET** | Used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data. |
| **HEAD** | Same as GET, but it transfers the status line and the header section only. |
| **POST** | Used to send data to the server (generally with JSON), for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms. |
| **PUT** | Replaces all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content. Like a POST, but to replace content. |
| **DELETE** | Removes all the current representations of the target resource given by URI. |

## Static files

To generate URLs for static files, use the special `static` endpoint name:

```Python
url_for('static', filename='style.css')
```
The file has to be stored on the filesystem as `static/style.css`.

## File uploads

Do not forget to set the `enctype="multipart/form-data"` attribute on your HTML form, otherwise the browser will not transmit your files at all.

Uploaded files are stored in memory or at a temporary location on the filesystem. You can access those files by looking at the **files** attribute on the request object. Each uploaded file is stored in that dictionary. It behaves just like a standard Python **file** object, but it also has a **save()** method that allows you to store that file on the filesystem of the server. Here is a simple example showing how that works:

```Python
from flask import request
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

@app.route('/upload', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def upload_file():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        f = request.files['the_file']
        f.save('/var/www/uploads/' + secure_filename(f.filename))
```

## Errors and redirect

See the full details on [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#redirects-and-errors)

```Python
from flask import abort, redirect, url_for

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return redirect(url_for('login'))

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    abort(401)
    this_is_never_executed()
```

## API with JSON

Useful documentation about good practices: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xxiii-application-programming-interfaces-apis

Itâ€™s easy to write a JSON API: If you return a dict from a view, it will be converted automatically to a JSON response.

```Python
@app.route("/me")
def me_api():
    user = get_current_user()
    return {
        "username": user.username,
        "theme": user.theme,
        "image": url_for("user_image", filename=user.image),
    }
```

You may want to create JSON responses for types other than `dict`. In that case, use the **jsonify()** function, which will serialize any supported JSON data type:

```Python
@app.route("/users")
def users_api():
    users = get_all_users()
    return jsonify([user.to_json() for user in users])
```
