# Git & GitHub 101

## Install Git

```Shell 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install git
```

## Link git to your Github account

### Create a SSH key
To login into github you need a **SSH-key**. Here is how to generate one.

1. Create an SSH key linked to your email.
```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
2. Save it to default location: (/home/*user_name*/.ssh/id_rsa): [Leave blank and press `Enter`]

### Add the SSH key to your github account

1. With xclip, copy the content of the file to your clip
```shell
sudo apt-get install xclip
xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

2. On github, go to your **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys** > **New SSH key**

3. Paste the key, add a title and save it.

```

### How to: Create a branch and commit your code
```shell
git branch bugFix # Create a bugFix branch
git checkout bugFix # Switch HEAD to bugFix branch
git commit
```

### How to: Merge branches
```shell
# To merge branch "bugFix" to "master", be sure to HEAD to master branch:
git checkout master
git merge bugFix # merge bugFix to master
```
### How to: Rebase
Useful to merge and "remove" (make invisible forever) a branch.

```shell
# To rebase branch "bugFix" to "master", be sure to HEAD to bugFix branch:
git checkout bugFix
git rebase master

# Then rebase master into bugFix.
git checkout master
git rebase bugFix
```

### How to: Keep your fork synced with the original repo

```shell
# 1. Fork the repo on github
# 2. Create a local clone of YOUR fork
git clone https://github.com/Joffreybvn/CRL-Turing-4.22.git

# 3. Go to your local repo
cd CRL-Turing-4.22

# 4. Add the ORIGIN repo as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/becodeorg/CRL-Turing-4.22

# 5. Update your local clone with the changes made on the origin repo
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master

# 6. Save the changes on github
git add -A
git commit
git push
```
